<p style="float:center; text-indent: 40px">Hello World. My name is Nikesh Shrestha. I am a 22 year old with a career interest in Engineering, more specifically, in the specialty areas of Robotics and Control. I am currently getting my Bachelor of Science in 
Engineering from the University of Maryland, and I am planning to pursue higher education to earn my masterâ€™s degree, then a Doctorate in Engineering. Getting a doctorate degree in engineering means that I would be one of the best 
in this field of study. Ever since being born in Nepal, I was always hungry for competition and had the appetite to win them all. Hence, I am pursuing in getting a doctorate in Mechanical Engineering and becoming among the best in this field of study. Getting a doctorate in 
Engineering is something in the far future, and my current focus is to set the foundation for my career path. As a senior in college, my immediate goals are to graduate and to study in a university with an excellent engineering program.</p>

<p style="float:center; text-indent: 40px">As you already know that I have decided to follow a career path in engineering. But why engineering? My interest in engineering first sparked during high school through various projects in physics and Intro to Engineering courses.
I remember enjoying every moment of brainstorming and building the vehicle; also, seeing my ideas come together into one finite object brought me a lot of happiness. Because of this, I had decided to choose engineering as my field of study in college. Although I had selected engineering, 
I was still debating between engineering and physics. Looking back, I am happy to say that I made the right choice to stay with engineering. Taking upper-level electives has allowed me to appreciate the beauty behind engineering. Physics is studying the laws that govern the world, which is a 
really fascinating topic to study, but engineers manipulate those laws and shape them to produce something that benefits humanity and leads to its growth and development. For example, physicists study material's electric properties and motion of charges etc., but engineers apply those knowledge to
fabricate transistors, semi-conductor chips and finally build a laptop. And as you already know, laptops are amazing devices that has the potential to do almost everything. Because of this, I will never regret my decision of choosing to pursue a career in engineering. </p>

<p style="float:center; text-indent: 40px">Now that you know why I love engineering, allow me to tell you about the specific field of engineering that I plan to pursue. Currently, my interest lies in engineering, especially Robotics, Control, and Automatic Systems. I am planning to have a career in the 
automotive industry where I help design and build autonomous vehicles that people can use easily and safely. To learn more about me and my experiences in this specific field, please continue exploring this website in the "About Me", "Projects" and "Hobbies" pages. </p>
